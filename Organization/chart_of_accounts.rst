**OMNIBUS ENTERPRISES CHART OF ACCOUNTS & FINANCIAL RECORD-KEEPING CONFIGURATION**

Preamble: Purpose and Philosophy
================================

This document establishes the official Chart of Accounts (COA) for Omnibus 
Enterprises. The COA is the foundational framework for categorizing all 
financial transactions of the Corporation. Its structure is a direct 
implementation of the  Principle of Rational Justification  and is designed to 
integrate seamlessly with the  Funding Allocation and Financial Management Policy .

The purpose of this COA is to ensure that financial records are maintained with 
accuracy, consistency, and transparency. It is structured to facilitate the 
generation of standard nonprofit financial statements (Statement of Financial 
Position, Statement of Activities), to comply with IRS Form 990 reporting 
requirements, and to provide the Board with clear insights into the financial 
health and operational efficiency of the Corporation.

Chart of Accounts
=================

Standard 4-digit account numbers are used. This structure is designed for use 
with accounting software that supports classes/tags for functional expense 
allocation.

Implementation and Procedures
=============================

Functional Expense Allocation
    This COA is designed to be used with a "class" or "tag" system in modern 
    accounting software. Every expense transaction  must  be assigned to one of 
    the following functional classes for Form 990 reporting:

    Program Services
        Costs directly related to carrying out the Corporation's mission 
        (e.g., expenses from the 8000 series).
    Management & General
        Costs for the overall operation and administration of the Corporation 
        (e.g., expenses from the 7000 series).
    Fundraising
        Costs incurred to solicit contributions (e.g., expenses from the 9000 
        series).
    
    Note: Personnel expenses (6000 series) must be allocated across these three 
    functions based on a reasonable estimate of time spent.

Software
    The Corporation shall select and use a reputable accounting software package 
    (e.g., QuickBooks Online, Xero) that supports nonprofit accounting, including 
    fund accounting and class-based tracking.

Budget Alignment
    The annual budget approved by the Board shall be structured using the same 
    account categories and codes as this Chart of Accounts to ensure direct 
    comparability and effective financial oversight.

Policy Review
    This Chart of Accounts shall be reviewed annually by the Treasurer and the 
    Board to ensure it remains relevant and adequate for the Corporation's needs.
