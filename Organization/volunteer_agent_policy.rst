Volunteer Agent Policy
======================

**OMNIBUS ENTERPRISES VOLUNTEER AGENT POLICY (Updated)**

Preamble: Philosophy and Purpose
================================

Omnibus Enterprises recognizes the value of community engagement and graciously 
welcomes the contributions of individuals who wish to volunteer their time and 
skills to advance our charitable, scientific, and educational mission. This 
policy establishes the framework for the engagement of Volunteer Agents and is 
rooted in the principles of mutual respect, clear communication, and rational 
justification.

The purpose of this policy is to define the relationship between the Corporation 
and its Volunteers, ensuring a productive and positive experience for all parties. 
It clarifies the distinct relationships for **Registered Volunteer Agents**, who 
engage in a formal capacity, and **Anonymous Volunteer Participants**, who contribute 
through a gamified, public-facing platform. It outlines the expectations, 
responsibilities, and protections applicable to Volunteers, including the formal 
recognition of their contributed time where applicable.

Article I: Definition and Status
================================

Section 1.1 Classes of Volunteer Contribution
    The Corporation recognizes two distinct classes of volunteer engagement:

    (a) **Registered Volunteer Agent:** An individual who, after an application and 
        onboarding process, formally agrees to contribute their time and skills to 
        the Corporation. This relationship is governed by a signed Volunteer 
        Agreement and involves direct, identified interaction with the Corporation's 
        internal systems and personnel.
    (b) **Anonymous Volunteer Participant:** An individual who contributes to the 
        Corporation's mission by interacting with its public-facing, gamified 
        systems (e.g., the "Omega Core" shared world). This relationship is 
        pseudonymous or anonymous, does not involve the collection of personal 
        information, and is governed by the terms of use agreed to upon each 
        instance of participation.

Section 1.2 No Employment Relationship
    For both classes of volunteers, the relationship is not one of employment. 
    Volunteers are not employees and are not entitled to any salary, wages, or 
    benefits provided to paid Agents.

Section 1.3 At-Will Engagement
    The volunteer relationship for both classes may be terminated at any time by 
    either the volunteer or the Corporation. For Anonymous Volunteer Participants, 
    this may manifest as the user ceasing to participate or the Corporation 
    revoking access for violation of the terms of use.

Article II: Engagement and Onboarding
=====================================

Section 2.1 Engagement of Registered Volunteer Agents
    (a) **Application & Agreement:** Registered Volunteer Agents must complete an 
        application process and sign a Volunteer Agreement outlining their status, 
        scope of activities, and commitment to abide by all applicable corporate 
        policies.
    (b) **Orientation:** Registered Volunteer Agents will receive an orientation 
        on the Corporationâ€™s mission, principles, and their role within the 
        operational structure.

Section 2.2 Engagement of Anonymous Volunteer Participants
    (a) **No Application:** There is no application or pre-registration required 
        to become an Anonymous Volunteer Participant.
    (b) **Just-in-Time Terms of Use Agreement:** Prior to each session of interaction 
        with the Corporation's public-facing systems, a participant must 
        affirmatively agree to the "Public System Terms of Use." This 
        click-through agreement shall include, at minimum:
        
        i. A code of conduct for interaction within the shared environment.
        ii. A confidentiality clause for any non-public information they might 
           encounter.
        iii. An explicit assignment of any intellectual property created within 
             or contributed to the system to Omnibus Enterprises or the public 
             domain, as determined by the Corporation.
        iv. A waiver of liability.

Article III: Scope of Activities and Coordination
=================================================

Section 3.1 Permitted Activities
    Volunteers may contribute in areas that align with their skills and the 
    Corporation's needs, such as research assistance, data entry, event support, 
    or other mission-related tasks. The Corporation reserves the right to 
    determine the suitability of tasks for volunteers.

Section 3.2 Coordination via The System
    The coordination of volunteer tasks and communication will, where feasible, 
    be facilitated through "The System." Volunteers will be given appropriate, 
    role-limited access to "The System" to receive task information, report 
    progress, and collaborate with others.

Section 3.3 Supervision
    A designated paid Agent or Officer shall be responsible for the overall 
    supervision and support of the volunteer program.

Article IV: Recognition and Valuation of Contributed Time
=========================================================

Section 4.1 Recognition of Registered Volunteer Agents
    (a) **Time Tracking & Valuation:** Time contributed by Registered Volunteer 
        Agents will be tracked in "Work Units" and valued in accordance with 
        the Work Unit and Time Policy to formally recognize the in-kind financial 
        value of their donation.
    (b) **Annual Contribution Statement:** Registered Volunteer Agents will receive 
        an annual "In-Kind Contribution Statement" detailing their valued 
        contribution for their records.

Section 4.2 Recognition of Anonymous Volunteer Participants
    (a) **No Individual Tracking:** The contributions of Anonymous Volunteer 
        Participants are not tracked on an individual basis.
    (b) **Aggregate Recognition:** Recognition may take the form of in-system 
        rewards, leaderboards (based on pseudonyms/avatars), and public 
        acknowledgment of the collective achievements of the participant community.
    (c) **Valuation of Aggregate Output:** The Corporation may assess and report on 
        the aggregate value generated by the collective efforts of all Anonymous 
        Volunteer Participants as a key metric of the program's success, but 
        this does not translate to individual valuation.

Article V: Adherence to Corporate Policies
==========================================

Section 5.1 Compliance
    Volunteers are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with all 
    corporate policies, upholding the same standards of respect, integrity, and 
    professionalism expected of paid Agents, as outlined in the Human Resources 
    Policy.

Section 5.2 Conflict of Interest & Gifting
    Volunteers are subject to the Conflict of Interest Policy (Bylaws Article XII) 
    and the Gift Acceptance Policy. They may not use their position for personal 
    gain and must direct any offered gifts or honoraria to the Corporation.

Article VI: Reimbursement
=========================

Section 6.1 No Compensation
    Volunteers perform their services without compensation. The valuation of time 
    in Article IV is for recognition purposes only and does not imply wages.

Section 6.2 Expense Reimbursement
    Volunteers may be eligible for reimbursement of reasonable, pre-approved 
    out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the direct performance of their duties 
    (e.g., required travel, supplies). All such reimbursements require prior 
    authorization from a designated Officer and submission of valid receipts.

Article VII: Intellectual Property and Confidentiality
======================================================

Section 7.1 Assignment of Intellectual Property
    The Volunteer Agreement shall specify that any work, inventions, discoveries, 
    or intellectual property created by the Volunteer within the scope of their 
    service to the Corporation is the sole and exclusive property of Omnibus 
    Enterprises.

Section 7.2 Confidentiality
    Volunteers may have access to confidential information. They must agree, via 
    the Volunteer Agreement, to keep such information confidential both during 
    and after their volunteer service with the Corporation.

Article VIII: Protections and Record Keeping
============================================

Section 8.1 Liability Protection
    The Corporation will provide Volunteers with the protections afforded under 
    applicable state and federal volunteer protection statutes (e.g., Washington 
    State's volunteer liability statute, the federal Volunteer Protection Act).

Section 8.2 Record Keeping
    The Corporation shall maintain records of all active Registered Volunteer 
    Agents, including their signed Volunteer Agreements and a summary of their 
    contributed service hours and valued contribution.

Article IX: Policy Review
=========================

This policy shall be reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors to 
ensure its continued effectiveness, legal compliance, and alignment with the 
Corporation's mission and principles.
