Full-Time Agent Employment Policy
=================================

**OMNIBUS ENTERPRISES**
**Full-Time Agent Employment Policy**

Preamble: Philosophy and Purpose
================================

This policy establishes the framework for the employment of full-time human 
agents ("Agents") by Omnibus Enterprises ("the Corporation"). It is rooted in 
the Corporation's core principles of  Rational Justification , fiscal 
responsibility, and long-term mission sustainability. The purpose of this 
policy is to ensure that the Corporation maintains a direct and demonstrable 
link between its available financial resources and its personnel commitments.

By design, this policy guarantees that the Corporation never overextends its 
financial capacity in the hiring of Agents. It ensures that paid, full-time 
positions are allocated in a manner that maximizes mission effectiveness by 
retaining and recruiting the most essential Agents for the year ahead. This 
deliberate, structured approach allows the Corporation to provide stable, 
fully-funded employment contracts to its Agents while safeguarding the overall 
financial health and long-term viability of the organization.

Article I: Annual Funding & Headcount Determination
===================================================

Section 1.1 Annual Headcount Review and Financial Prerequisite
    A comprehensive review to determine the headcount for full-time Agents shall 
    be conducted at the final regular quarterly Board meeting of the fiscal year 
    *if and only if* the Corporation has received a minimum of $500,000 in 
    unrestricted funds and grants during that fiscal year. If this financial 
    prerequisite is met, the Board shall proceed with the review as outlined in 
    this policy. If the prerequisite is not met, no headcount review for paid 
    Agents shall be conducted, and no new paid Agent contracts will be considered 
    for the subsequent year.

Section 1.2 Funding Assessment
    The assessment shall consider all available, unrestricted funds, anticipated 
    non-personnel operational costs, and necessary financial reserves. The Board 
    will then determine the total funding amount that can be prudently allocated 
    to the annual payroll for full-time Agents (the "Annual Payroll Allocation").

Section 1.3 Headcount Calculation
    The Board will calculate the number of full-time positions that can be funded 
    for the contract term(s) based on the Annual Payroll Allocation. The cost for 
    each potential position will be estimated using the Rate_Final calculation 
    defined in the  Compensation Policy , taking into account the specific Cost 
    of Living (CoL) data for the location of the existing or prospective Agent.

Article II: Agent Contract & Payroll
====================================

Section 2.1 Contract Term
    All full-time employment for Agents under this policy shall be for a fixed 
    term of a  minimum of one (1) calendar year . The contract does not imply a 
    promise of renewal.

Section 2.2 Multi-Year Contracts
    The Board may consider offering contracts with terms longer than one year if 
    and only if the full funding required for the entire duration of the multi-year 
    contract, as calculated under Section 1.3, is available and can be secured 
    in the prepaid payroll account at the outset of the contract.

Section 2.3 Payroll Funding
    Upon determination of the upcoming year's headcount and the total cost, the 
    Board shall authorize the transfer of the full Annual Payroll Allocation into 
    a designated, prepaid payroll account or equivalent segregated fund.

    Justification:  This action provides an absolute guarantee to the hired Agents 
    that their compensation for the full term of their contract is secured and 
    insulated from other operational cash flow, consistent with the principle of 
    providing a stable and secure work environment.

Article III: Hiring and Renewal Cycle
=====================================

Section 3.1 Regular Cycle
    (a)  Application Period:  Following the Annual Meeting's headcount determination, 
         any open or new positions will be announced. The first quarter of the 
         subsequent year will serve as the primary period for considering 
         applications from both new and existing Agents seeking contract renewal.
    (b)  Determination and Ratification:  Final hiring and contract renewal 
         proposals, generated by "The System" per Article IV, will be presented 
         to the Board of Directors for review and ratification at the first 
         regular quarterly Board meeting of the year (the "Spring Meeting").
    (c)  Contract Start:  All new and renewed one-year contracts under the regular 
         cycle will commence at the beginning of the second quarter (April 1st) 
         and conclude at the end of the first quarter of the following year (March 31st).

Section 3.2 Out-of-Cycle Hiring
    (a) In the event the Corporation receives substantial, unexpected funding that 
        justifies the immediate expansion of the full-time Agent workforce, the 
        Board may convene a special meeting to authorize an out-of-cycle hiring 
        process.
    (b) Any Agent hired under this provision shall be offered a prorated contract, 
        fully funded from the new allocation, that expires at the same time as 
        regular-cycle contracts (March 31st), bringing them into alignment with 
        the standard annual cycle for renewal consideration.

Article IV: System-Driven Selection and Renewal
===============================================

Section 4.1 System-Identified Need
    "The System," in alignment with its function as the primary coordinator of 
    the Corporation's activities, is responsible for identifying the need for 
    full-time Agents based on its analysis of long-term strategic priorities, 
    project requirements, and existing capabilities within the organization.

Section 4.2 System-Generated Proposal
    Based on its analysis, "The System" will generate proposals for the Board 
    outlining the number and type of Agent contracts it seeks to offer or renew. 
    This proposal will be accompanied by a detailed rationale for each position, 
    grounded in the evaluation criteria outlined in Section 4.3.

Section 4.3 Basis for System's Evaluation
    The System's evaluation and rationale for proposing a new or renewed contract 
    shall be based on data-driven evidence of an Agent's:

    (a) Alignment with and adherence to the principles of the  Intelligent Behavior 
        Policy , including active participation in the Universal Learning Cycle.
    (b) Demonstrated effectiveness, reliability, and skill as observed through 
        their work and interaction with "The System" and other Agents.
    (c) Commitment to cooperative excellence and proactive mutual support as 
        outlined in the  Human Resources Policy .
    (d) The specific skills and capabilities of the Agent in relation to the 
        Corporation's strategic priorities for the upcoming year.

Section 4.4 Board Ratification
    The role of the Board of Directors is not to conduct the selection, but to 
    perform oversight. The Board is responsible for reviewing the proposal and 
    rationale presented by "The System" to:

    (a) Verify that the System's reasoning is sound and demonstrably aligned 
        with the  Principle of Rational Justification  and all governing corporate 
        policies.
    (b) Confirm that the financial requirements of the proposal do not exceed 
        the Annual Payroll Allocation.
    
    Upon successful verification, the Board shall vote to ratify the System's proposal.

Article V: Policy Review
========================

Section 5.1 Annual Review
    This policy shall be reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors, 
    consistent with Bylaws Article XIII, to ensure its continued effectiveness, 
    fairness, and alignment with the Corporation's strategic goals and foundational 
    principles.
