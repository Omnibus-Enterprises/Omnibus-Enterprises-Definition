Work Unit and Time Policy

**OMNIBUS ENTERPRISES WORK UNIT AND TIME POLICY**

Preamble: Philosophy and Purpose
================================

This policy establishes the standard, quantifiable unit of labor within Omnibus 
Enterprises. It is founded on the  Principle of Rational Justification  and 
cognitive science principles that promote deep, sustainable focus by building 
in periods of rest.

The purpose of this policy is to define labor in a way that values focused 
effort while preventing burnout. It creates a consistent metric that underpins 
both the Compensation Policy for paid Agents and the valuation of contributed 
time for Volunteer Agents. This ensures that all contributions of time and 
effort are measured and recognized under a single, equitable standard, 
facilitated by "The System."

Article I: Definitions
======================

Section 1.1 Focus Block
    A "Focus Block" is an uninterrupted period of twenty (20) minutes dedicated 
    to a specific, defined task.

Section 1.2 Focus Cycle
    The core actionable unit of labor is the "Focus Cycle." A Focus Cycle 
    consists of one (1) twenty-minute Focus Block immediately followed by a 
    five-minute Rest Period. The total elapsed time of a Focus Cycle is 
    twenty-five (25) minutes.

Section 1.3 Work Unit
    The fundamental compensable unit of labor is the "Work Unit." One (1) 
    Work Unit is earned upon the completion of one (1) Focus Cycle. For all 
    payroll and valuation purposes,  one Work Unit is valued as thirty (30) 
    minutes of time (equivalent to 0.5 Billable Hours).  This structure 
    intentionally rewards the 25 minutes of structured effort with 30 minutes 
    of value. 

Section 1.4 Billable Hour
    A "Billable Hour" is defined as the value earned by completing two (2) 
    Work Units.

Article II: Implementation and Flexibility
==========================================

Section 2.1 Tracking
    All time contributed by both paid and volunteer Agents shall be tracked 
    by completing and logging Focus Cycles via "The System."

Section 2.2 Chaining Cycles
    Agents may perform multiple Focus Cycles consecutively. The five-minute 
    Rest Period at the end of one cycle serves as the break before the next 
    Focus Block begins. For example:

    Completing two consecutive Focus Cycles (20 min focus + 5 min rest + 20 
    min focus + 5 min rest) takes a total of 50 minutes of actual time and 
    earns two (2) Work Units, equivalent to one (1) Billable Hour of value.

Section 2.3 Recommended Practice
    While the tracked cycle begins with the Focus Block, it is a recommended 
    best practice for Agents to take a five-minute rest  before  beginning a 
    session of one or more Focus Cycles to prepare for a state of deep work.

Section 2.4 Application
    The "Billable Hour" as defined in this policy serves as the standard unit 
    for all calculations under the Compensation Policy and for the valuation 
    of contributed time under the Volunteer Agent Policy.

Article III: Policy Review
==========================

This policy shall be reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors to 
ensure its continued effectiveness and alignment with the Corporation's 
operational realities and foundational principles.
