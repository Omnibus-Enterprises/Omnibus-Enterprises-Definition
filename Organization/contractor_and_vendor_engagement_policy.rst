Contractor and Vendor Engagement Policy
=======================================

**OMNIBUS ENTERPRISES CONTRACTOR AND VENDOR ENGAGEMENT POLICY**

Preamble: Philosophy and Purpose
================================

This policy establishes the framework for engaging Independent Contractors and 
Vendors ("Contractors") to provide specific services to Omnibus Enterprises. It 
is founded on the  Principle of Rational Justification , ensuring that the use 
of external services is a deliberate, transparent, and fiscally responsible 
decision made to support the Corporation's mission.

The purpose of this policy is to provide a clear and consistent process for 
selecting, engaging, and managing Contractors. It aims to ensure that the 
Corporation acquires necessary services under fair terms, mitigates risks 
through formal agreements, maintains clear legal and financial distinctions 
between contractors and employees, and fully complies with the Conflict of 
Interest Policy and all applicable laws.

Article I: Definitions and Distinction
======================================

Section 1.1 Independent Contractor/Vendor
    An Independent Contractor is a self-employed individual or entity engaged 
    to perform a specific scope of work or provide a defined service or product 
    for a specified fee. Contractors retain control over the means and methods 
    of accomplishing their work and are not subject to the day-to-day supervision 
    of the Corporation in the manner of an employee.

Section 1.2 No Employment Relationship
    Contractors are not employees (Agents) or Volunteer Agents of the Corporation. 
    They are not eligible for employee benefits, and the Corporation will not 
    withhold taxes from their payments. The terms of the Human Resources Policy 
    and Compensation Policy do not apply to Contractors.

Article II: Justification and Selection
=======================================

Section 2.1 Justification for Use
    The Corporation may engage Contractors for reasons including, but not limited to:

    (a) Requiring specialized skills or expertise not available among paid or 
        volunteer staff.
    (b) Addressing a temporary or one-time need where hiring a full-time Agent 
        is not justified.
    (c) Procuring standard goods or services (e.g., legal counsel, accounting 
        services, equipment).

Section 2.2 Selection Process
    The selection of Contractors shall be an objective process based on 
    qualifications, experience, quality of service, cost-effectiveness, and 
    references. For significant engagements, a competitive bidding process may 
    be required.

Section 2.3 Conflict of Interest
    All potential engagements must be vetted through the lens of the Conflict of 
    Interest Policy (Bylaws Article XII). Any potential conflict involving a 
    Director, Officer, or Agent must be disclosed and managed according to the 
    procedures outlined in the Bylaws.

Article III: Contractual Agreement
==================================

Section 3.1 Written Contract Required
    All engagements with Contractors must be formalized in a legally binding, 
    written agreement signed by both parties  before  any work commences.

Section 3.2 Required Contract Terms
    The agreement must, at a minimum, clearly define:

    (a)  Scope of Work:  A detailed description of the services to be performed 
         and the specific deliverables expected.
    (b)  Compensation:  The total fee, payment schedule, and invoicing procedures. 
         Payment shall be tied to deliverables or project milestones, not based 
         on hours worked in the manner of an employee.
    (c)  Term:  The start and end dates of the agreement.
    (d)  Independent Contractor Status:  A statement explicitly affirming the 
         Contractor's status as an independent contractor and not an employee.
    (e)  Intellectual Property:  A clause specifying that all work product 
         ("work made for hire") created under the agreement is the sole property 
         of Omnibus Enterprises.
    (f)  Confidentiality:  A non-disclosure clause to protect the Corporation's 
         confidential information.
    (g)  Insurance and Indemnification:  Requirements for the Contractor to 
         maintain appropriate insurance (e.g., general liability, professional 
         liability) and to indemnify the Corporation.
    (h)  Termination:  Conditions under which either party may terminate the 
         agreement.

Article IV: Authority and Management
====================================

Section 4.1 Authority to Engage
    (a) Officers of the Corporation are authorized to engage Contractors for 
        services up to a specified value, as determined by a resolution of the 
        Board of Directors.
    (b) Any contract exceeding this specified value requires prior approval from 
        the Board of Directors.

Section 4.2 Oversight
    Each Contractor engagement shall have a designated Officer or paid Agent who 
    serves as the primary point of contact. This individual is responsible for 
    monitoring the Contractor's performance against the terms of the agreement, 
    reviewing deliverables, and approving invoices.

Section 4.3 Interaction with The System
    A Contractorâ€™s interaction with "The System" will be strictly limited and 
    role-based, providing access only to the information and tools essential for 
    fulfilling their contractual obligations. They are not integrated into the 
    general Agent-System operational model.

Article V: Financial Procedures
===============================

Section 5.1 Invoicing
    Contractors must submit detailed invoices as specified in their agreement. 
    All invoices will be reviewed and approved by the designated point of contact 
    before payment is processed.

Section 5.2 Tax Reporting
    The Corporation will issue IRS Form 1099-NEC or other required tax forms to 
    all qualifying Contractors, as required by law.

Article VI: Record Keeping
==========================

Section 6.1 Contract File
    The Corporation shall maintain a complete file for each Contractor engagement, 
    including the signed agreement, any proposals, all approved invoices, and a 
    record of payments. These records will be maintained for a period consistent 
    with the Corporation's document retention policy.

Article VII: Policy Review
==========================

This policy shall be reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors to 
ensure its continued effectiveness, legal compliance, and alignment with the 
Corporation's mission and principles.
