Google Workspace Usage and Governance Policy
=========================================

**OMNIBUS ENTERPRISES GOOGLE WORKSPACE USAGE AND GOVERNANCE POLICY**

Preamble: Philosophy and Purpose
================================

This policy governs the use of the Google Workspace suite of tools ("Workspace") 
by all personnel of Omnibus Enterprises. It is founded on the  Principle of 
Rational Justification , recognizing Workspace as a fiscally responsible and 
functionally essential platform for collaboration, communication, and 
record-keeping, secured through the Google for Nonprofits program.

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that Workspace is used in a secure, 
consistent, and effective manner that directly supports the Corporation's 
mission. It defines the specific role of each Workspace application within our 
operational framework and clarifies the relationship between Workspace and our 
core algorithmic intelligence, "The System." Workspace serves as a foundational 
productivity layer, facilitating human-to-human collaboration and administrative 
functions that underpin and provide data to "The System," but it is not "The 
System" itself.

Article I: Scope
================

Section 1.1 Applicability
    This policy applies to all individuals granted access to the Corporationâ€™s 
    Google Workspace environment, including Directors, Officers, paid Agents, 
    and Volunteer Agents ("Personnel"). Contractors may be granted limited, 
    role-based access as necessary.

Section 1.2 Corporate Asset
    All Google Workspace accounts, and all data created or stored within them, 
    are the property of Omnibus Enterprises.

Article II: Designated Use of Core Applications
===============================================

To ensure operational consistency, each Workspace application has a designated 
primary purpose:

Section 2.1 Gmail ( @omnibus.enterprises )
    The official and exclusive channel for all professional electronic mail 
    communication with external parties. It may also be used for internal 
    administrative communications not suited for "The System's" task-management 
    channels.

Section 2.2 Google Drive & Shared Drives
    The official, primary repository for all corporate documents, records, and 
    work-in-progress files.

    (a)  Shared Drives:  All official corporate work and documentation  must  
         be created and stored within designated Shared Drives to ensure 
         corporate ownership and continuity. Use of individual "My Drive" for 
         storing official corporate files is prohibited.
    (b)  Folder Structure:  Shared Drives shall be organized according to a 
         rationally-justified, high-level structure (e.g., GOVERNANCE, 
         FINANCE, OPERATIONS, PROJECTS, RESEARCH) to ensure information is 
         easily retrievable.
    (c)  Record Redundancy:  Google Drive shall serve as one of the two distinct 
         methods for maintaining essential corporate records, as required by 
         Bylaws Section 9.2.

Section 2.3 Google Calendar
    The official tool for scheduling all synchronous meetings (internal and 
    external), tracking time-sensitive corporate deadlines (e.g., compliance 
    filings), and indicating personal availability outside of System-managed tasks.

Section 2.4 Google Docs, Sheets, & Slides
    The standard, required applications for creating and collaboratively editing 
    text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

Section 2.5 Google Meet
    The official and exclusive platform for conducting all synchronous audio/video 
    conference meetings, including Board of Directors meetings.

Section 2.6 Google Forms
    The primary tool for creating and distributing surveys, internal feedback 
    forms, and data intake mechanisms that are not integrated directly into 
    "The System."

Section 2.7 Google Admin Console
    Restricted to authorized administrators for the management of user accounts, 
    security settings, and device policies in accordance with this policy.

Article III: Account Management and Security
============================================

Section 3.1 Provisioning
    All personnel will be provisioned a corporate Google Workspace account. 
    Account creation and disabling are centralized administrative functions. 
    Accounts shall follow a standard naming convention (e.g., 
    firstname.lastname@omnibus.enterprises).

Section 3.2 Security Mandates
    Security is paramount. The following are mandatory for all accounts:

    (a)  Strong Passwords:  All users must maintain a strong, unique password 
         for their account.
    (b)  Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):  2FA must be enabled on all accounts 
         without exception.

Section 3.3 Device Management
    Any device (computer, smartphone, tablet) used to access corporate data via 
    Google Workspace may be subject to baseline security policies enforced through 
    Google Endpoint Management. This is to protect corporate data in the event a 
    device is lost or stolen.

Section 3.4 Offboarding
    Upon termination of an individual's relationship with the Corporation, their 
    Workspace account will be suspended immediately. All data will be preserved 
    and transferred to an archival account or relevant Shared Drive, and the user 
    account will be deleted after a designated period.

Article IV: Data Management and Ownership
=========================================

Section 4.1 Data Ownership
    All data and information created, sent, received, or stored in the Omnibus 
    Enterprises Google Workspace environment are the property of the Corporation. 
    This includes emails, files, chat logs, and calendar entries.

Section 4.2 No Expectation of Privacy
    Personnel should have no expectation of personal privacy in their use of 
    corporate Workspace accounts. The Corporation reserves the right to access, 
    monitor, and disclose information within any user's account for legitimate 
    business purposes, including security audits, compliance reviews, and 
    responding to legal requests.

Section 4.3 Data Retention
    Data will be retained in accordance with the Corporation's broader Data 
    Retention Policy. In general, data will be kept as long as it has operational, 
    legal, or historical value and will be securely disposed of when it no longer 
    serves a mission-aligned purpose.

Article V: Acceptable Use
=========================

Section 5.1 Professional Purpose
    The Google Workspace environment is provided for activities related to the 
    Corporation's mission.

Section 5.2 Incidental Personal Use
    Extremely limited and incidental personal use is permissible, provided it 
    does not interfere with professional responsibilities, consume significant 
    resources, violate any corporate policy, or expose the Corporation to risk.

Section 5.3 Prohibited Activities
    Users may not use Google Workspace to:

    (a) Engage in any illegal activity or transmit illegal materials.
    (b) Harass, discriminate against, or threaten any individual.
    (c) Transmit or store confidential corporate data outside of authorized channels.
    (d) Infringe upon copyrights or intellectual property rights.
    (e) Intentionally bypass or subvert security measures.

Article VI: Policy Review
=========================

This policy shall be reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors to 
ensure its continued effectiveness, security, and alignment with the 
Corporation's mission and technological capabilities.
