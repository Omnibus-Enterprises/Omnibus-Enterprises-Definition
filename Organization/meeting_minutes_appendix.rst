Q2 - First Meeting
------------------

**MINUTES OF THE FIRST MEETING OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS**

**OF**

**OMNIBUS ENTERPRISES**

**(A Washington Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation)**

**Date:** April 27, 2025

**Time:** 4:15 PM Pacific Time

**Location:** Meeting held via secure virtual communication.

1. Call to Order
    The meeting was called to order at 4:15 PM by Matthew Mark Souto, the sole 
    initial Director.

2. Confirmation of Director Status
    It was confirmed that Matthew Mark Souto is the sole initial Director of 
    Omnibus Enterprises, as named in the Articles of Incorporation filed with 
    the Washington Secretary of State (UBI No. 605-859-157). As the sole Director, 
    Matthew Mark Souto constitutes a quorum of the Board.

3. Purpose of Meeting
    The purpose of this meeting was stated as the organization of the corporation 
    following its incorporation, including the adoption of Bylaws, the adoption 
    of key operating policies, the election of officers, and the authorization 
    of initial corporate actions.

4. Adoption of Bylaws
    The proposed Bylaws of Omnibus Enterprises, having been previously reviewed, 
    were presented to the Board. Upon motion duly made and seconded (by unanimous 
    consent of the sole Director), the following resolution was adopted:

    **RESOLVED**, that the Bylaws presented at this meeting are hereby adopted as 
    the Bylaws of Omnibus Enterprises, and a copy of said Bylaws shall be inserted 
    in the corporate records.

    *(Adopted by M.M. Souto)*

5. Adoption of Key Policies
    The following key corporate policies, having been previously reviewed and 
    developed, were presented to the Board:
    
    * Conflict of Interest Policy [As detailed in Bylaws Article XII]
    * Gift Acceptance Policy 
    * Compensation Policy 
    * Human Resources Policy 
    * Intelligent Behavior Policy 
    * Conflict Resolution Procedure 

    It was noted that these policies are designed to align with the Bylaws, the 
    Principle of Rational Justification, and the mission of the Corporation. Upon 
    motion duly made and seconded (by unanimous consent of the sole Director), the 
    following resolution was adopted:

    **RESOLVED**, that the Conflict of Interest Policy (as embedded in the Bylaws), 
    the Gift Acceptance Policy, the Compensation Policy, the Human Resources Policy, 
    the Intelligent Behavior Policy, and the Conflict Resolution Procedure presented 
    at this meeting are hereby adopted as official policies of Omnibus Enterprises, 
    and copies shall be maintained in the corporate records.

    *(Adopted by M.M. Souto)*

6. Election of Officers
    The meeting proceeded to the election of officers as required by Article VI 
    of the Bylaws. The Bylaws require a President, a Secretary, and a Treasurer. 
    Bylaw Section 6.1 permits one person to hold multiple offices, except for the 
    offices of President and Secretary. However, given that Matthew Mark Souto is 
    currently the sole Director and individual involved, and Washington Law (RCW 
    24.03A.435(2)) permits an individual to hold more than one office, it is 
    necessary for the sole Director to hold all required offices initially. This 
    potential conflict with the stricter language of Bylaw 6.1 is noted for future 
    review per Bylaw Article XIII.

    Nominations were made for the following individuals to serve in the specified 
    offices until the next annual meeting or until their successors are elected 
    and qualified:
    
    * President: Matthew Mark Souto
    * Secretary: Matthew Mark Souto
    * Treasurer: Matthew Mark Souto

    Upon motion duly made and seconded (by unanimous consent of the sole Director), 
    the following resolution was adopted:

    **RESOLVED**, that Matthew Mark Souto is hereby elected President of Omnibus 
    Enterprises.

    **RESOLVED**, that Matthew Mark Souto is hereby elected Secretary of Omnibus 
    Enterprises.

    **RESOLVED**, that Matthew Mark Souto is hereby elected Treasurer of Omnibus 
    Enterprises.

    *(Elections accepted by M.M. Souto)*

7. Authorization of Bank Account
    Discussion was held regarding the need to establish a bank account for the 
    Corporation. Upon motion duly made and seconded (by unanimous consent of the 
    sole Director), the following resolution was adopted:

    **RESOLVED**, that the President or Treasurer of this Corporation is authorized 
    and directed to open a bank account or accounts in the name of Omnibus 
    Enterprises with a financial institution to be selected by such officer(s).

    **RESOLVED FURTHER**, that the President and Treasurer are hereby authorized 
    signatories for such accounts, and are authorized to execute any necessary 
    documents required by the financial institution to establish and operate said 
    accounts.

    *(Approved by M.M. Souto)*

8. Authorization of IRS Form 1023 Filing
    The importance of obtaining 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status was discussed. Upon 
    motion duly made and seconded (by unanimous consent of the sole Director), the 
    following resolution was adopted:

    **RESOLVED**, that the President is authorized and directed to prepare and file 
    Form 1023, Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3), 
    with the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of Omnibus Enterprises.

    **RESOLVED FURTHER**, that the President or Treasurer is authorized to pay the 
    required IRS user fee for Form 1023 from corporate funds as soon as such funds 
    become available.

    *(Approved by M.M. Souto)*

    located at 2820 304th St. E, Graham, WA, 98338-9729, consistent with the Registered 
    Office address listed in the Articles of Incorporation.

    *(Confirmed by M.M. Souto)*

10. Designations for Conflict Resolution Procedure
    Pursuant to the adopted Conflict Resolution Procedure [Article III], the 
    following initial designations were made:
    
    * Designated Conflict Resolution Intake Point: The Corporate Secretary 
      (currently Matthew Mark Souto).
    * Designated Oversight Authority: The Corporate President (currently Matthew 
      Mark Souto), acting in a documented neutral capacity as required by the 
      Procedure until such time as the Board determines a different designation 
      is warranted and feasible.

    *(Approved by M.M. Souto)*

11. Adjournment

5. New Business: Review and Ratification of Foundational Policies
    The Board proceeded to review and vote on a series of foundational policies.

    a.  **Board Meeting Procedure:** The policy was discussed. An amendment was proposed 
        and accepted to Section 5.3 (Storage and Redundancy) to better align with the 
        "documentation as code" principle, specifying a version-controlled repository 
        as the primary source of truth.
        
        **RESOLVED**, that the policy titled "Board of Directors Meeting Operations 
        and Procedure," as amended, is hereby adopted.

    b.  **Work Unit and Time Policy & Compensation Policy:** The "Work Unit and Time 
        Policy" was reviewed. An inconsistency was identified with the "Compensation 
        Policy." A motion was made to adopt the "Work Unit and Time Policy" as the 
        definitional source and to amend the "Compensation Policy" for consistency.

        as presented.
        **RESOLVED FURTHER**, that the "Compensation Policy" is hereby adopted, incorporating 
        the amendments to Sections 3.1, 4.1, and 4.3 as discussed and recorded to align 
        its terminology with the "Work Unit and Time Policy."

    c.  **Full-Time Agent Employment Policy:** The policy was reviewed. An amendment was 
        proposed and accepted to Article I, Section 1.1, to add a financial prerequisite 
        of $500,000 in annual funding before the annual headcount review process for paid 
        agents is triggered.
        
        **RESOLVED**, that the policy titled "Full-Time Agent Employment Policy," as amended, 
        is hereby adopted.

    d.  **Volunteer Agent Policy:** The policy was discussed at length. A significant 
        amendment was proposed and accepted to restructure the policy to define two 
        distinct classes of volunteers: "Registered Volunteer Agents" and "Anonymous 
        Volunteer Participants," the latter contributing through a future gamified, 
        anonymous platform.
        
        **RESOLVED**, that the policy titled "VOLUNTEER AGENT POLICY," as amended and 
        restated to incorporate two classes of volunteers, is hereby adopted.

        **RESOLVED**, that the policy titled "Google Workspace Usage and Governance Policy" 
        is hereby adopted as presented.

    g.  **Funding Allocation and Financial Management Policy:** The policy was reviewed. The 
        Board discussed and established specific funding thresholds for transitions between 
        tiers for use in strategic planning and donor communication. The policy itself was 
        found to be excellent as is.
        
        **RESOLVED**, that the policy titled "Funding Allocation and Financial Management 
        Policy" is hereby adopted as presented.

    h.  **Chart of Accounts & Financial Record-Keeping Configuration:** The policy was

        implementation.

        Configuration" is hereby adopted as presented.

6. Final Resolution: Authorization to Consolidate and File
