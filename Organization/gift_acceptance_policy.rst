Gift Acceptance Policy
======================

**OMNIBUS ENTERPRISES GIFT ACCEPTANCE POLICY**

Article I: Purpose and Philosophy
=================================

Section 1.1 Guiding Principles
    This policy establishes guidelines for the solicitation, acceptance, recording, and 
    acknowledgment of gifts made to Omnibus Enterprises ("the Corporation"). It is rooted 
    in the Corporation's core values, including the Principle of Rational Justification 
    (Bylaws Article III), ensuring that all gift acceptance practices:

    (a) Strictly align with and advance the Corporation's charitable, scientific, and 
        educational mission as defined in the Articles of Incorporation.
    (b) Comply fully with all applicable legal and ethical standards, particularly those 
        governing 501(c)(3) organizations.
    (c) Are handled with sound financial practices, transparency, and proper stewardship.
    (d) Avoid actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest, consistent with 
        Bylaws Article XII.

Section 1.2 Organizational Representation and Agent Acknowledgment
    All individuals acting on behalf of Omnibus Enterprises (defined as "Personnel" in 
    Section 2.1) must understand and operate under the principle that **when representing 
    the Corporation, they function as agents of the Corporation, acting solely for its 
    benefit.** This distinction between personal capacity and their official role as agents 
    is fundamental. To ensure this understanding is embedded:

    (a) All Personnel will receive training on this policy and the nature of their role 
        and responsibilities **as agents of the Corporation**.
    (b) As a condition of their engagement or employment, all Personnel shall **formally 
        acknowledge in writing** their understanding and acceptance of this principle, 
        their duty of loyalty to act solely in the Corporation's best interest when 
        performing their duties, and their specific responsibilities under this Gift 
        Acceptance Policy. This acknowledgment may be recorded within the Corporation's 
        central system.

Section 1.3 Rationale Regarding Personnel Gifts
    Consistent with the Corporationâ€™s Compensation Policy, which ensures Personnel receive 
    fair and sufficient compensation, and the principle outlined in Section 1.2 that 
    Personnel act as agents of the Corporation, there is no organizational or personal 
    justification for Personnel accepting gifts, tips, or honoraria in a personal capacity 
    related to their duties. Accepting such personal benefits would conflict with their 
    **role as agents** and could undermine impartiality, equity, and mission focus. 
    Therefore, this policy mandates that any such offers intended for individuals due to 
    their role within the Corporation be treated exclusively as donations to the Corporation 
    itself.

Article II: Scope
=================

Section 2.1 Applicability
    This policy applies to all gifts received by the Corporation, regardless of type or 
    value, and governs the actions of all directors, officers, employees, agents, and 
    volunteers ("Personnel") concerning the solicitation and acceptance of gifts.

Section 2.2 Definition of "Gift"
    For the purposes of this policy, a "gift" includes any voluntary transfer of assets or 
    provision of services to the Corporation or offered to its Personnel *because of their 
    affiliation with and role as agents representing the Corporation*, without expectation 
    of direct economic benefit or privilege in return from the Corporation. Gifts may include, 
    but are not limited to: cash, checks, securities, real or personal property (tangible 
    or intangible, including intellectual property), bequests, beneficiary designations, 
    charitable gift annuities, remainder trusts, lead trusts, and in-kind donations or 
    services. "Tips," "gratuities," or "honoraria" offered to Personnel in relation to 
    their work for the Corporation are considered potential gifts under this policy.

Article III: Authority to Accept Gifts
======================================

Section 3.1 Board Authority
    The Board of Directors ("Board") holds ultimate authority and responsibility for the 
    acceptance of all gifts made to the Corporation.

Section 3.2 Delegation
    The Board may delegate the authority to review and accept certain types or values of 
    gifts to specific officers or committees, as documented in Board resolutions or other 
    governing procedures. However, the acceptance of certain complex or potentially 
    burdensome gifts (e.g., real estate, closely held securities, gifts with significant 
    restrictions) may require specific Board approval.

Article IV: Prohibition on Personal Gifts to Personnel
======================================================

Section 4.1 Strict Prohibition
    **Reflecting their acknowledged role as agents of the Corporation (Section 1.2)**, no 
    Personnel of Omnibus Enterprises may solicit or accept, for their personal benefit, 
    any gift, tip, gratuity, honorarium, or item of value offered to them because of their 
    position or work performed for the Corporation. This prohibition applies regardless of 
    the item's value, source, or the intent of the offeror.

Section 4.2 Required Understanding
    Personnel, having received training and provided written acknowledgment as per Section 
    1.2, are expected to operate consistently with this prohibition **while acting in their 
    capacity as agents of the Corporation**.

Section 4.3 Procedure for Handling Offers
    When offered a gift, tip, or honorarium personally in connection with their work:

    (a) The Personnel member shall receive the offer or item.
    (b) The Personnel member must immediately state that, **in accordance with organizational 
        policy reflecting their role as an agent of the Corporation, such expressions of 
        appreciation related to their work are accepted directly on behalf of Omnibus 
        Enterprises.**
    (c) The Personnel member shall **thank the offeror sincerely on behalf of the 
        Corporation** for their support of its mission.
    (d) The Personnel member must then **immediately proceed to process the offer/item as a 
        donation to the Corporation.** This involves:
        
        i. Securely handling the item (e.g., cash, check, object) explicitly as 
           organizational property.
        ii. Accurately **documenting the donation** (donor name/contact if provided or 
            obtainable without intrusion, description of item/amount, date, circumstances) 
            **using designated corporate procedures, ideally via entry into the Corporation's 
            central system ("the System"),** as soon as practically possible. This documentation 
            is crucial for organizational records and potential donor acknowledgment.
        iii. Promptly transferring the physical item (if applicable) and ensuring the 
             documentation is submitted (e.g., finalized within the System or physically 
             delivered with the item) to the appropriate department or officer responsible 
             for official recording and acknowledgment.

    (e) The Corporation, not the individual Personnel member, is responsible for formally 
        acknowledging the donation and providing any necessary receipts according to 
        standard procedures (Article VI), based on the information documented by the 
        Personnel member.

Section 4.4 *De Minimis* Exception
    This prohibition does not apply to unsolicited items of truly nominal value generally 
    distributed as promotional material or social courtesy (e.g., pens, keychains, a cup 
    of coffee offered during a meeting) that create no sense of obligation and could not 
    reasonably be perceived as influencing judgment or contradicting the Personnel member's 
    **role as an agent of the Corporation**. When in doubt, Personnel should err on the side 
    of caution and treat the item as a potential donation under Section 4.3 or consult with 
    the appropriate officer or designated contact point.

Article V: Acceptance Procedures for Organizational Gifts
=========================================================

Section 5.1 Review Criteria
    The Corporation will evaluate potential gifts based on:

    (a) **Mission Alignment:** Consistency with the Corporation's stated purposes and values.
    (b) **Legal & Ethical Compliance:** Adherence to all applicable laws and ethical standards.
    (c) **Financial Soundness:** Consideration of any costs associated with accepting the gift 
        (e.g., maintenance, insurance, appraisal, disposal costs).
    (d) **Restrictions:** Reasonableness and feasibility of any donor-imposed restrictions. 
        The Corporation will generally not accept gifts with conditions that are unduly 
        burdensome, costly to administer, inconsistent with the mission, or violate the 
        Articles or Bylaws.
    (e) **Reputational Impact:** Potential effect on the Corporation's public image and relationships.
    (f) **Conflict of Interest:** Assessment for any potential conflicts as per Bylaws Article XII.

Section 5.2 Specific Gift Types
    (a) **Cash/Checks:** Readily accepted unless suspected to be from illegal activities.
    (b) **Publicly Traded Securities:** Readily accepted, typically liquidated upon receipt 
        unless otherwise determined by the Board.
    (c) **Real Estate/Tangible Personal Property:** Require careful review, including potential 
        environmental assessment, title search, appraisal, assessment of carrying costs, 
        marketability, and mission utility. Board approval is generally required.
    (d) **Closely Held Securities:** Require careful review due to potential valuation and 
        marketability issues. Board approval is generally required.
    (e) **Planned Gifts (Bequests, Trusts, etc.):** Accepted subject to review for alignment 
        with the Corporation's financial instruments and policies. Donors are encouraged to 
        seek independent legal and financial advice.
    (f) **In-Kind Services:** Accepted on a case-by-case basis if they genuinely meet a need, 
        can be appropriately supervised and valued, and do not substitute for budgeted 
        expenses without proper authorization.

Section 5.3 Right to Refuse
    The Corporation reserves the right to decline any gift that is deemed inconsistent 
    with its mission, policies, or best interests, or if the acceptance process is deemed 
    too burdensome.

Article VI: Gift Valuation and Acknowledgment
=============================================

Section 6.1 Valuation
    Non-cash gifts accepted by the Corporation will be valued in accordance with IRS 
    regulations and generally accepted accounting principles. Significant non-cash gifts 
    may require an independent appraisal obtained by the donor or the Corporation.

Section 6.2 Acknowledgment
    The Corporation will provide timely written acknowledgment (receipt) for all donations 
    qualifying for tax deduction, compliant with IRS requirements. **The process may be 
    initiated or facilitated by the System based on documented donation information.**

Section 6.3 Tax Advice
    The Corporation does not provide tax, legal, or financial advice to donors. Donors are 
    encouraged to consult with their own independent advisors.

Article VII: Use of Gifts
=========================

Section 7.1 Purpose
    All accepted gifts will be used to further the Corporationâ€™s tax-exempt purposes as 
    outlined in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.

Section 7.2 Restricted Gifts
    The Corporation will honor the donor's restrictions on the use of a gift, provided 
    such restrictions were reviewed and formally accepted at the time of the gift according 
    to Section 5.1(d). If circumstances change making the restriction impractical or 
    impossible, the Corporation will seek appropriate legal remedies or donor consent to 
    modify the restriction.

Section 7.3 Unrestricted Gifts
    Gifts received without donor restriction will be used for the general purposes of the 
    Corporation as determined by the Board.

Article VIII: Confidentiality
=============================

Section 8.1 Donor Information
    Donor information will be kept confidential to the extent required by law and 
    organizational policy. The Corporation will not sell, trade, or share its donor 
    list without explicit permission, except as legally required. Anonymous requests 
    will be honored.

Article IX: Policy Review and Compliance
========================================

Section 9.1 Annual Review
    This Gift Acceptance Policy shall be reviewed at least annually by the Board of 
    Directors or its designated committee to ensure its continued relevance, effectiveness, 
    and compliance with law and best practices, consistent with Bylaws Article XIII.

Section 9.2 Compliance
    All Personnel are expected to understand and comply with this policy, having formally 
    acknowledged their responsibilities **as agents of the Corporation** as outlined in 
    Section 1.2. Violations may result in disciplinary action, up to and including 
    termination of their relationship with the Corporation.
